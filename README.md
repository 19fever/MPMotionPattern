Motion Pattern from Camera Detector for iOS

# What it is

This is basically a proto-typing project. The camera of your iPhone can tell how the iPhone itself is moving by analysing the video taken. 

# How to use this

Compile and install it, tap "start" button, move your iPhone to the up you can see a blue arrow appear. That's itâ€¦

# How it looks like
